## Sideloading add-ons
You may want to send a user your add-onâ€™s XPI file by some means other than a web download, such as an email distribution of a beta version for user testing. In this case, there are two practical options for installing the add-on:

- Using Install Add-on From File in the Add-ons Manager.
- Adding the file to one of the standard extension folders.
